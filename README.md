# 🚀 Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
The **Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard** is a sleek and intuitive **PyQt6-based** GUI application designed to monitor **system resource usage** and manage running processes in real time. It provides **dynamic visualizations** for CPU, memory, and disk usage, along with an **interactive process manager** to search, view, and terminate processes effortlessly.

## 🎯 Features
✅ **Real-time System Monitoring**: Tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage with dynamic visual graphs.  
✅ **Process Management**: Displays active processes, sorted by CPU usage, with an instant search option.  
✅ **Process Termination**: Select and terminate processes directly from the interface.  
✅ **User-friendly Interface**: A modern dark-themed UI designed using PyQt6 with interactive elements.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3** – Core programming language.
- **PyQt6** – GUI Development.
- **PyQtGraph** – Graphical plotting.
- **Psutil** – System resource monitoring.
